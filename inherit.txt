Q5: Why do we use inheritance?

1. Code reusability: inheritance allows us to reuse code by defining common attributes and behaviors in a 
base class that a child class can also use (inherit). This helps reduce the amount of code we write and 
eliminate redundancy. 
    --> for example, I can make a bird base class with color and flySpeed as attributes 
    I can have hawk and pigeon inherit the attributes from base class bird where each species has its
    own color and flying speed without having to redefine them.

2. Easier maintenance: Performing any change or fixes in a derived class will only affect that section
of our code, and won't cause a chain of errors for other classes. 
Vice versa, fixing or adding features in the base classes fixes subsequent errors in all the derived 
classes. All in all, we spend much less time maintaining our code and we produce less chances of creating
errors or bugs.
